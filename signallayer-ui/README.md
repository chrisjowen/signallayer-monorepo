# SignalLayer: The Expert Filterer UI

> "In an era of infinite content, curation is the only moat."

SignalLayer is the frontend implementation of the Expert Filterer—a curation engine designed to protect high-stakes professionals from learning debt by identifying the 1% of voices with real "Proof of Work."

## 🚀 Launch Strategy: "The Signal Wedge"
We are launching with a high-intensity market test focusing on **Specialized Tech Research**. Instead of a broad tool, we are providing a "Signal Dashboard" for specific, high-velocity topics where noise is highest.

- **Objective**: Validate the "Rubric of Signal" with real users.
- **Conversion**: Drive users to a "Deep Signal" subscription/waitlist.

## 🎨 Design/UX Tone: "Authority-Modern"
Designed by **Luna**, the UI is built for precision and clarity.
- **Vibe**: Control center for truth. High density, low fatigue.
- **Aesthetics**: Dark mode (`bg-slate-950`), Glassmorphism, Neon-cyan signal accents.
- **Typography**: `Outfit` (Headings) / `Inter` (Body).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: SvelteKit
- **UI Library**: shadcn-svelte
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS & Vanilla CSS
- **Visualization**: LayerChart / D3 (planned)
