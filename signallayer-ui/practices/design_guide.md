# Cofounder Hub Brand & Style Guide

## Brand Vision
Cofounder Hub is the high-leverage workspace where human vision meets AI execution. It represents the pinnacle of premium, strategic partnership.

## Tone & Voice
- **Strategic**: Focused on high-level outcomes and leverage.
- **Intelligent**: Precise, data-driven, and sophisticated.
- **Partnership-first**: Not a tool/user dynamic, but a cofounder relationship.
- **Premium**: Every interaction should feel polished, intentional, and high-quality.

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: `hsl(222.2 47.4% 11.2%)` (Deep Navy / Slate)
- **Accent**: `hsl(199 89% 48%)` (Electric Blue)
- **Background**: `hsl(0 0% 100%)` (Light) / `hsl(224 71% 4%)` (Dark)
- **Neutral**: Grays and low-saturation blues.

### Typography
- **Headings**: *Outfit* or *Inter* (Bold, high tracking for uppercase).
- **Body**: *Inter* or *System Sans-Serif*.
- **Monospace**: *JetBrains Mono* for code and data.

### Design Principles
1. **Clarity**: High contrast, generous whitespace.
2. **Glassmorphism**: Subtle translucency for cards and overlays to create depth.
3. **Micro-Animations**: Smooth transitions (200ms-300ms) for hover states and navigation.
4. **Data-Native**: Visualizations and data should feel like first-class citizens.

## UI Components (Shadcn/Svelte)
We use Shadcn Svelte for a "built-in" feel. 
- **Buttons**: Rounded-md, subtle shadows.
- **Cards**: Minimal borders, slight elevation on hover.
- **Inputs**: Clean, legible, focus rings in Accent color.

## Imagery
- Use abstract, high-contrast imagery representing networks, nodes, and growth.
- Avoid generic stock photos of people in offices.
- Focus on the "Pulse" of the system.
